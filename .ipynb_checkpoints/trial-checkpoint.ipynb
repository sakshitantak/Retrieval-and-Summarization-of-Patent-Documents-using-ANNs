    "text = \"The present invention relates to a cycle tyre tool and more specifically to a tool for removing tyres from the wheels of cycles namely monocycles, bicycles and tricycles. Tyres are normally removed from cycle wheels by means of three tyre levers which are used to lever the bead of the tyre over the rim of the cycle wheel. A problem arises in the use of tyre levers for this purpose in that there is a very real danger of trapping the inner tube between the lever and the bead of the tyre and thus damaging the inner tube. The object of the present invention is to provide a tool that enables tyres to be removed very readily while assisting in avoiding damage to the inner tube. The present invention consists in a cycle tyre tool for removing tyres from cycle wheels consisting of a handle, a shaft or sleeve rotatable relative to the handle and projecting therefrom and, at the free end of the shaft or sleeve, a roller member shaped and constructed for insertion between the bead of a cycle tyre and the rim of a cycle wheel and engagement with the bead, the roller member being freely rotatable in relation to both the sleeve and the handle. In order that the nature of the invention may be better understood a preferred embodiment thereof is hereinafter described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:- The tool, in a preferred form, consists of a handle 10 into which fits a shaft 11. The shaft 11 is free to rotate in the handle 10 but is restrained against axial movement by the press-on claw clip 12. At the free end of the shaft is a roller member 13 that is fixed at the end of the shaft 11. On the portion of the shaft 11 projecting from the handle 10 is a sleeve 14 that is rotatable on the shaft 11. In an alternative construction (not illustrated) the sleeve 14 is omitted and the roller member 13 is rotatably mounted on the shaft 11. In use for removing a tyre the tool is held in the hand of the user and the roller 13 is inserted between the rim of the wheel and the bead of the tyre, as shown in Fig. 3, after the inner tube 15 has been fully deflated. The blunt end presented by the roller 13 serves to push the inner tube 15 out of the path of the tool as it enters between the rim and the bead. Once the tool is fully entered the handle is depressed, as shown in Fig. 4, so that the bead 17 is forced upwardly and outwardly in relation to the rim. The tool is then rolled around the circumference of the rim 16 with the sleeve 14 resting on the rim 16 and the roller 13 resting against the inside of the tyre 19 adjacent the bead 17 (as shown in Fig. 4). It will, however, be appreciated that the sleeve 14 and the roller 13 will be rotating at different speeds due to their making contact respectively with the rim 16 and the tyre 19 at different distances from the centre of the wheel 20. It is thus necessary that the sleeve shall be rotatable relative to the handle and the roller 13 rotatable relative to the sleeve. In the alternative construction referred to above the shaft rolls on the rim and the roller rotates on the shaft when in contact with the tyre, the important feature in both constructions being that the parts in contact with the rim and the tyre can rotate independently. Once the tool has been moved around the complete circumference of the wheel the bead of the tyre can be lifted out of the well of the wheel rim and the tyre can be readily removed. The tool may also be used for replacing the tyre by reversing the steps described above after slightly inflating the inner tube 15. The construction described is given by way of example only as constituting a preferred form of the invention within the broad scope thereof as defined in the succeeding claims.\""
